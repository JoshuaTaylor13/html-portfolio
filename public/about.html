<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Joshua Taylor, I was born in the California bay area, where I stil reside today. From my windows 95 PC,
  voodoo graphics card, and closet full of CRT monitors, to building modern PC's, tearing apart all the technology I could,
  reading books, breaking other's code; I've spent my life learning all I can about computers and the science behind them.
</p>

<p>My love of nature took me to the local parks where I was a Park Ranger for a number of years. I continued my studies
  of computer science, web development, and general coding lakeside, and have begun my professional approach towards
  a career in the Web Development world.
